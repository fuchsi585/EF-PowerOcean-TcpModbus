**Local Modbus TCP integration for the EcoFlow PowerOcean Plus home battery system.**

> ⚠️ This integration communicates directly with your device over your local network via Modbus TCP. No cloud connection required.

---

## Features

- **Local polling** – no EcoFlow cloud account needed
- **Configurable poll interval** (5–60 seconds, default 10 s)
- Real-time power flow: house consumption, grid import/export, solar generation, battery
- Full battery monitoring: SOC, voltage, current, power, temperature, remaining energy
- Per-string PV power, current and voltage (configurable 1–3 strings, phantom current filtering)
- Per-phase AC measurements: voltage, current, frequency
- Energy counters: daily and lifetime for grid, solar, battery charge/discharge, house consumption
- Configurable battery capacity (workaround for unreliable register value)
- Reconfigurable after setup via **Settings → Configure** (no re-install needed)
- Debug logging toggle directly in the HA UI
- German and English translations
